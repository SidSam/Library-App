# Library-App

This app allows you to implement a simply library management system. As a guest user, you can simply view all the books. 
Once you login, you can check out a book, check it in, add your own book and edit or delete your added books. 
However, you can't edit or delete books created by other users.

Built using the Flask framework, ORM done through SQLAlchemy and security features implemented through OAuth.
